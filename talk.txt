Rainy Day Stories: 

This is an introduction to Temporal Logic, based the system called "D",
studied by Arthur Prior and Robert Bull.

I haven't seen Temporal Logic used in Recreational Maths and would like to introduce this system.
It is easy enough that anyone can understand it, but compelling enough to make interesting puzzles.

; There's only four symbols to learn, so please pay attention, because you're going to need these four.
; R means Rain on the day in question, which by default is today.
; Circle (@@) means TOMORROW.  Whatever follows the circle is true tomorrow.
; Diamond (%%) means EVENTUALLY, at least once. Whatever follows the diamond is true at least once, EITHER today, OR tomorrow, OR some day in the future.
; Box (##) means FOREVERMORE.  Whatever follows the box is true today, AND tomorrow, AND every day into the future.

How to remember them:

>g   @@  = The "point" TOMORROW.
A circle is like a big point, and that point in time is TOMORROW.

>g   %%  = EVENTUALLY at any point
A diamond has many points, and ANY day will do.

>g   ##  = FOREVERMORE
A box looks like a calendar, marking ALL days, starting today.

Four Example Rainy Day Stories (1=Rain, 0=NoRain):

>y 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0...
>y 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1...
>y 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0...
>y 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1...

; This is how I visualize Rainy Day Stories. 
; Each line of 1s and 0s is a Story.
; 1 means Rain, 0 means No Rain.
; The first digit on each line is whether it rains today.
; The second digit is whether it rains tomorrow.
; The third digit is the next day, and so forth, into the future.

; Raining Today matches the 1st and 4th story, because they start with a 1, meaning Rain Today.

; TOMORROW RAIN matches the 2nd and 4th story, because they have a 1 in the second position, meaning Rain Tomorrow.

; EVENTUALLY RAIN matches all but the 3rd story, which has no rainy days at all.

; FOREVERMORE RAIN only matches the last story, in which every day is rainy.

; Two circles in a row means "Tomorrow's Tomorrow"; three circles is the day after that.
; So, it rains THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and also THE DAY AFTER THAT.
; That matches the first and the last story, which both have "1"s in the 3rd and 4th position.

>g   %%##R

Eventually, it will rain forevermore.
"It may rain off and on for a while, but some day it will rain and never quit."

; The next two get interesting.
; Diamond Box R means ... Eventually ... it will rain forevermore.
; That is, it may rain off an on for a while, but some day it will rain and never quit.

>g   ##%%R

Forevermore... it will eventually rain.
"No matter how far in the future we go, it will always rain again."

; Box Diamond R means Forevermore it will eventually rain.
; No matter how far in the future we go, it will always rain again.
; If our story is that it only rains on prime-numbered days, that story would match, because no matter how far we go, there's always another prime.

Can you write expressions for these:

>g (1) "It rains only every other day."

(Your expression must match exactly two stories.)


>g (2) "Whenever it rains, it rains exactly two days in a row (never one, never three)."

(But it may not rain at all.)
